# e-commerce-back-end

The following code shows the back-end of an e-commerce company.
With the use of GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests we are able
to see the the categories, products, tags, prices and how many 
items are in stock. 
We are also able to add products, categories and tags, update them 
and delete them as well. 
In order to get this to work you must run an npm run seed followed
by npm start and with the use of insomnia you can make the requests 
listed above
